"""Mnemoverse MCP Agent: memory over the Model Context Protocol, end to end.

The agent never imports a memory SDK. It starts the Mnemoverse memory server as
a subprocess, speaks MCP to it over stdio, and does four things through the
protocol:

    1. discovery  - list_tools(), so you see the ten tools and their arguments
    2. write      - memory_write, to record decisions
    3. read       - memory_read, to recall them in a later session
    4. feedback   - memory_feedback, to report how a recalled memory worked out

Step 4 is the point. Recall is ranked, and telling the service that a recalled
item helped changes where it lands next time. The run prints the order on both
sides of that call so you can see the move.

The model step in between is optional. Without a Nebius key the agent still
walks the protocol and prints every result.
